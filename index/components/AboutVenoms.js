            <h2>Why venoms?</h2>
            <p>
                Venoms are complex mixtures of organic molecules and inorganic cofactors that have evolved over millions of years for both defensive and offensive purposes. Venoms are highly specific to each venomous species, so every venom is unique. Considering that a single venom can have hundreds of active protein components, as well as the fact that there are believed to be millions of venomous species on the planet, venoms are one of the richest sources of bioactive molecules in nature.

                The pharmaceutical industry is constantly searching for new drug candidates to treat every kind of illness. However, in recent years, drug discovery has slowed. In response to this, scientists have begun to search historically neglected sources of molecules that have effects on the human body, and venoms have been one of the primary classes of these.

                VenomKB was designed to address the fact that most venom-based drug development has used hypothesis-driven methods to search for treatments to specific diseases using traditional methods. Instead, data-driven drug discovery research techniques could allow us to query all venom proteins and all diseases simultaneously increasing the likelihood of finding more effective treatments for a wider array of diseases in a shorter time.
