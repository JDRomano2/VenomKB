            <p>
                Venoms&#8212;one of the most common and iconic classes of animal toxins&#8212;have been used for various therapeutic purposes since the dawn of recorded history. They are complex mixtures of proteins, carbohydrates, steroids, and inorganic cofactors, many of which have complex and highly specialized mechanisms of action when introduced to animal tissue. Recently, science has found a number of ways these mechanisms of action can be exploited for purposes beneficial to human health.

                VenomKB was designed to address the fact that these discoveries are not collected in any single location, as well as the belief that the vast majority of therapeutic uses for venom components have yet to be discovered.
